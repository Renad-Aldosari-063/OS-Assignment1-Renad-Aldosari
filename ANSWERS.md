## Question 1: Thread vs Process

**Question**: Explain the difference between a **thread** and a **process**. Why did we use threads in this assignment instead of creating separate processes?

**Your Answer:**

[A process is an independent program with its own memory space and system resources, while a thread is a smaller unit of execution inside a process. Threads within the same process share memory and resources, but each thread still has its own execution path. In general, threads are lighter than processes because they require less creation overhead and allow faster communication through shared data. In this assignment, we used threads because the scheduler simulation needs multiple execution units inside one program, which is why the code creates each process as a Runnable object and then wraps it in a Thread in the addProcessToQueue method. This design makes it easier to manage the ready queue, connect each thread to its process through processMap, and control execution using methods such as start, join(), and sleep (). Compared with separate processes, threads were more suitable for this simulation because they are more efficient and easier to coordinate within SchedulerSimulation.java.]

## Question 2: Ready Queue Behavior

**Question**: In Round-Robin scheduling, what happens when a process doesn't finish within its time quantum? Explain using an example from your program output.

**Your Answer:**

[Write your answer here. Describe the specific behavior - where does the process go? When does it run again? Give an example from your actual program output showing a process that was re-queued.]

Example from my output:
```
[Paste a relevant snippet from your program output here showing a process being re-queued]
```

**Explanation of example:**
[Explain what's happening in the output snippet you pasted]

## Question 3: Thread States

**Question**: A thread can be in different states: **New**, **Runnable**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Terminated**. Walk through these states for one process (P1) from your simulation.

**Your Answer:**

[Write your answer here. For each state, explain when P1 enters that state during the simulation. Use your understanding of the code to trace through the lifecycle.]

1. **New**: [When is P1 in New state?]

2. **Runnable**: [When does P1 become Runnable?]

3. **Running**: [When is P1 Running?]

4. **Waiting**: [When/why would P1 be Waiting?]

5. **Terminated**: [When is P1 Terminated?]

## Question 4: Real-World Applications

**Your Answer:**

### Example 1: [Name of application/scenario]

**Description**: 
[Describe the real-world scenario or application]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**:
